            <b>'Rice'</b> is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa. As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide population after sugarcane and maize.<br/>Rice a monocot is normally grown as an annual plant, although in tropical areas it can survive as a perennial and can produce a ratoon crop for up to 30 years. Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water.<br/><br/>At Star Organic Farm we have a lot of rice products.

                    <p>Basmati is a variety of long, slender-grained aromatic rice which is traditionally from the Indian subcontinent. India accounts for over 70% of the world's basmati rice production. A small portion of that is being grown organically.<br/>Basmati rice has a typical pandan like flavour caused by an aroma compound. Basmati grains contain about 0.09% of this aromatic chemical compound naturally.</p>

                    <h3>OFADA RICE</h3>
                    <p>Ofada rice is a name of heritage varieties of rice grown in south-west Nigeria. It is used in a variety of dishes. Ofada rice are mostly in blends, and some of the rice varieties in the blens are noy indigenous to Africa; however they also contain African rice.<br/>Ofada rice is unpolished. As African rice is more difficult to mill and polish, some or all of the rice bran is left on the grain, strenghtening the flavour and making it more nutritious.</p>
