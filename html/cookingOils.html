            <b>'Cooking Oil'</b> is plant, animal, or synthetic fat used in frying, baking, and other types of cooking. It is also used in food preparation and flavoring not involving head such as salad dressings and bread dips, and in this sense might be more accurately termed edible oil.<br/>Cooking oil is typically a liquid at room temperature, although some oils contain saturated fat such as coconut oil. Oil can be flavoured with aromatic foodstuffs such as herbs, chillies or garlic. All oils degrade in response to heat, ight and oxygen.
