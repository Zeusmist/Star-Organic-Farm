        <section id="writeUp">
            An <b>'Oil'</b> is any nonpolar chemical substance that is a viscous liquid at ambient temperatures and is both hydrophobic and lipophilic. Oils have a high carbon and hydrogen content and are usually flammable and surfave active.<br/>Oils may be animal, vegetable, or petrochemical in origin, and may be volatile or non-volatile. They are used for food (e.g., olive oil), fuel(e.g., heating oil), medical purposes(e.g., mineral oil), lubrication(e.g., motor oil), and the manufacture of many types of paints, plastics and many other materials.<br/>Specially prepared oils are used in some religious ceremonies and rituals as purifying agents.<br/><br/>At Star Organic Farm we have a lot of oil products.

                    <h3>OLIVE OIL</h3>
                    <p>Olive oil is a liquid obtained from olives, a traditional tree crop of the Mediterranean Basin. The oil is produced by pressing whole olives. It is commonly used in cooking, whether for frying or as a salad dressing. It is also used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and soaps, and as fuel for traditional oil lamps.<br/>Today, Spain is the largest producer of olive oil by volume, followed by Italy and Greece.</p>

                    <h3>PALM OIL</h3>
                    <p>Palm oil is an edible vegetable oil derived from the reddish pulp of the fruit of the oil palms.<br/>Palm oil, like all fats, is composed of fatty acids, esterified with glycerol. Palm oil has an especially high concentration of saturated fat.<br/>Red palm oil is rich in carotenes, such as alpha and beta carotene and lycopene which gives it a characteristic dark red color.</p>

It is widely used in cosmetics as a moisturizer, salve or lotion.<br/>Shea butter is edible and is used in food preparation in some African countries.<br/>It is also used by soap makers and massage oil manufacturers, typically in small amounts.</p>
