            <b>'Legume'</b> is a plant in the family Fabacae. The fruit or seed of such a plant is called a <i>pulse</i> especially in the mature dry condition. Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for human consumption, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure.Legumes produce a botanically unique type of fruit (a simple dry fruit that develops from a simple carpel and usually opens a long seam on two sides). A comon name for this type of fruit is a pod. Legumes are notable in that most of them have symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in structures called root nodules. For that reason they play a key role in crop rotation.<br/><br/>At Star Organic Farm we have a lot of pulse products. Which include the following :

Peas are starchy, but high in fiber, protein, phosphorous, magnesim, copper, iron, zinc and several vitamins.</p>
