            <b>'Cereals'</b> are grasses cultivated for the edibile components of thier grain. Cereals are a rich source of vitamins, minerals, carbonhydrates, fats, oils and protein. The warm season cereals are grown in tropical lowlands year-round and in temperate climates during the frost free season. Cool season cereals are more well adapted to temperate climates. Winter varieties do not flower until springtime because they require vernalization: exposure to low temperatures for a genetically determined length of time.
